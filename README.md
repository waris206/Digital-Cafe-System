# Digital Cafe System

## Project Overview
The Digital Cafe System is a comprehensive application designed to streamline the operations of a cafe by allowing different roles (admin, employee, and student) to interact with the system efficiently. The system handles inventory management, order processing, employee tracking, and sales analysis, providing an all-in-one solution for cafe management.

## Features

### 1. **User Roles**
- **Admin**: Manages cafe inventory, monitors employee performance, and reviews sales reports.
- **Employee**: Updates stock, processes orders, and assists in daily operations.
- **Student**: Places orders online, reserves tables, and tracks their orders.

### 2. **Login and Registration**
- Secure login system for admins, employees, and students.
- New users can register based on their roles.
- Login credentials and role management ensure user-specific functionalities.

### 3. **Inventory and Stock Management**
- Real-time tracking of cafe stock, with the ability to add, update, and delete items.
- Notifications for low stock levels, enabling proactive restocking.
- Inventory reports for better resource management.

### 4. **Order Management**
- **Online Ordering**: Students can browse the available menu and place orders online.
- **Order Processing**: Employees can view and process orders efficiently.
- Order status updates allow users to track the preparation of their meals.

### 5. **Table Reservation**
- Students can reserve tables online through the system.
- Admins and employees can manage reservations, ensuring table availability.

### 6. **Sales Analysis and Reporting**
- Detailed sales reports for tracking daily, weekly, and monthly performance.
- Statistical analysis of cafe sales, including best-selling items and peak hours.
- Export reports to file for future reference.

### 7. **Employee Management**
- Tracks employee records, incentives, and work performance.
- Employee shift management ensures efficient resource allocation.

### 8. **File Handling**
- Data is stored persistently using file handling to manage users, orders, and sales data.
- The system can recover and display data from previous sessions seamlessly.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **C++**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
- **File Handling Support**: Ensure file handling capabilities for storing user, inventory, and sales data.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waris206/Digital-Cafe-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Digital-Cafe-System
   ```
3. Compile the code using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o DigitalCafeSystem
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./DigitalCafeSystem
   ```

## Usage
- **Login**: Upon running the system, users can log in based on their role.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage inventory, employees, and view sales reports.
